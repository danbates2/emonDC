#### print notes

Print v1d on a Makerbot Replicator2 with white PLA. temperature at 230degC and speed set quite fast. 10%infill, two layer shell.
Version 1d was too small, either from calibration of printer problem or shrinkage of the PLA.
Version 1f should be the correct size, but may need scaling up or down a percent or two either way depending on your setup. I also gave more vertical space for the cable connections.
