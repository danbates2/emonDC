Ambient Temperature, 8.5degC. 8th Dec, 2018.

Camera model: Flir T200

The emissivity setting for the images was at 0.85 for the FR4 PCB material. Therefore, the temperature colour-scale to the right of the image relates to the temperature of the FR4, approximately.

- Approximately 120amps RMS AC from welding machine.

- The limit of the thermal camera was 150degC, this was reached.

- The shunt was desoldered from the board after about 1 minute, therefore it reach a the melting point of 100% Tin/Ni+ solder.

- Very little heat energy was conducted outside of the copper rectangle of the mounting and shunt area. However, I have modified the trace downstream to be thinner, minimizing heating of the fuses and shunt monitor.

- Most of the heat was conducted through the cable connection. The highest temperature was at the shunt and the immediately surrounding copper and solder mask.

- Imaging the rear of the board, less than expected heat came through the vias, and more than expected was transmitted directly from under the center of the shunt, straight through the PCB. Note: check via design.
